#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to develop and maintain high-quality software systems, involving design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Importance in the Technology Industry
Creation of Essential Software Systems: It enables the development of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.
Reliability and Efficiency: By applying engineering principles, software engineering ensures that software systems are reliable, efficient, and scalable, which is essential for maintaining user trust and satisfaction


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of Programming Languages (e.g., Fortran, C)
The creation of programming languages was a crucial milestone in software engineering, as it enabled developers to write complex software more efficiently.
2. The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s-1980s)
    Introduced structured code that improved readability and maintainability.
3. The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (2000s)
   In response to the limitations of rigid development models like Waterfall, the Agile Manifesto was introduced it emphazied on iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Gathering:
This phase involves collecting and documenting user needs and system requirements. It ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the software should achieve and how it will meet user expectations.

Design:
During this phase, developers create both high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface. This includes defining the overall structure, programming languages, and security measures to ensure the software is user-friendly and compatible with existing systems.

Implementation:
In this stage, developers write code and build the software according to the design specifications. The focus is on creating efficient, secure, and maintainable code that aligns with the project's goals.

Testing:
Testing is critical for ensuring the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. Various types of tests are conducted, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, to identify and fix bugs before deployment.

Deployment:
Once testing is complete, the software is released to users or customers. This phase involves setting up the software in the production environment, which can be on-premise or in the cloud, depending on the project's needs.

Maintenance:
After deployment, ongoing support is provided to address issues, apply updates, and add new features. This phase ensures that the software remains functional, relevant, and aligned with evolving user needs over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase (such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment) must be completed before moving on to the next. In contrast, Agile is an iterative and flexible approach that allows for continuous development, testing, and feedback throughout the project.

Waterfall is rigid and does not easily accommodate changes once a phase is completed, whereas Agile is highly adaptable and welcomes changes at any stage of development. 

Customer involvement in Waterfall is limited, as feedback is typically gathered at the end of the project, while Agile encourages continuous customer collaboration throughout the development process.

Testing in Waterfall occurs after the implementation phase, which increases the risk of discovering major issues late in the project. In Agile, testing is integrated into each iteration, allowing for early identification and resolution of problems.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
A Software Developer is responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code to implement software solutions. They translate project requirements into functional applications by using programming languages, frameworks, and development tools
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that the software meets the required quality standards by designing and executing test plans. They identify defects, report issues, and work closely with developers to ensure bugs are fixed before deployment.
Project Manager
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. They define project goals, create timelines, allocate resources, and ensure that the development process stays on track. Project managers act as a bridge between stakeholders, developers, and other team members, facilitating communication and resolving conflicts.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 
Are essential tools that streamline the software development process by providing a comprehensive suite of features for writing, debugging, and testing code.For example, Visual Studio, NET and C# development, Eclipse is popular for Java programming, and IntelliJ IDEA is a preferred choice for Kotlin and Java development.
Version Control Systems (VCS)
Plays a crucial role in managing source code changes and coordinating work among multiple developers. VCS allows developers to track modifications, revert to previous versions, and collaborate efficiently without the risk of losing progress. (For example, Git, Subversion)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements – Frequent changes cause scope creep and delays.
Solution: Use Agile methodologies, maintain clear communication, and design flexible architectures.
Tight Deadlines – Pressure to deliver quickly can reduce quality.
Solution: Prioritize tasks, reassess timelines, and use automation tools to streamline development.
Technical Debt – Shortcuts lead to long-term maintenance issues.
Solution: Refactor code, follow best practices, and maintain proper documentation


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing 
Involves testing individual units or components of the software in isolation. It ensures that each unit functions as expected before integrating it with other components.
Integration testing 
combines two or more units or modules to verify that they work together seamlessly. It checks for interface, communication, and data flow issues between modules.
System testing 
Evaluates the entire software system to ensure it meets all functional requirements. It simulates real-world scenarios to validate that all components work harmoniously.
Acceptance testing, 
Also referred to as User Acceptance Testing (UAT), involves verifying that the software meets the agreed-upon business and user requirements.

Importance in Software Quality Assurance
Identify Defects Early: Unit and integration testing help detect issues early, reducing the cost and complexity of fixing them later.

Ensure System Integrity: System testing verifies that all components work together correctly, ensuring the software functions as intended.

Validate User Expectations: Acceptance testing confirms that the software meets user needs and expectations, ensuring it provides value to stakeholders.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs  to optimize responses from AI models. It involves structuring queries effectively to guide the AI in generating accurate, relevant, and high-quality outputs.

Importance of Prompt Engineering in Interacting with AI Models
Improved Accuracy and Relevance:
Well-crafted prompts ensure that AI models understand the intent behind the query, leading to more accurate and relevant outputs
Improves Efficiency 
Optimized prompts reduce the need for multiple attempts to get the desired output, saving time and effort.
Reduces Ambiguity 
Clear prompts minimize misinterpretation, ensuring that the AI provides logical and meaningful answers.
Unlocking AI Potential:
Prompt engineering plays a pivotal role in unleashing the full potential of generative AI models. By refining prompts, engineers can significantly improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated content, whether it's text or images.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:"Tell me about technology."
Improved Prompt:
"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry, including benefits and challenges."
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective?
More Specific – Instead of a broad request about "technology," the improved prompt focuses on artificial intelligence in healthcare.
Clear Intent – It explicitly asks for both benefits and challenges, guiding the AI to provide a balanced response.
Concise and Direct – It eliminates ambiguity, ensuring a targeted and relevant answer without unnecessary generalization.
